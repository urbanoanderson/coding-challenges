# Coding Challenges

## About

This project has a compilation of solutions for different programming challenges available at websites such as [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) or [Daily Coding Problem](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/) as well as books and other places. It's purpose is for mental refresh studies on algorithms as well as unit testing and TDD practices. Solutions made in my spare time and may not necessarily be optimal.

When I begin to solve a challenge in this repository a branch is created for it. First, I create the empty challenge class with some essential interface methods. Then I create a unit test class with testcases for many different scenarios. After that I implement a solution for the challenge that passes all the unit tests and finally merge the challenge branch to master.

## To Run

### .NET

To run challenges implemented in .NET run command `dotnet test`
